# **Project**

## Objective

Clicks Project is an app that allows user to connect with other people online or in person by joining different events shared by users. This full stack advanced front end project was created using React.js, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Django and Bootstrap.

Clicks API provides a backend database to create, view, edit and delete different items. Users can share a post, leave a comment on different posts and like post and comments. A user who wishes to share an event can upload information about the event, including the date, and a description. Other user can rate an event and also leave a comment on it. Events can be saved by users so they don't miss out on it.
